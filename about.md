# About Me

I’m a software engineer and geographer-in-training, working on my Masters in Geospatial Data Science. I find GIS so interesting because it sits at the intersection of many different disciplines.

When I find the time, I work on music as an emcee and producer, though it's been a while since I graced a stage or released any new music. Lately, I've been running and just finished my first public 5k.

I have a very bipolar relationship with both data and AI. I strongly dislike the surveillence age we live in (see Survellience Capitalism by Shoshana Zuboff), but I love the promise of explaining our world through data and using conclusions to affect positive change. As for AI, I'm worried about the change in learning and creativity we're abruptly making without evidence that we'll produce "better" work.

- **Current role:** Senior Software Engineer at Bentley Systems, working on the iTwin Platform as a generalist.
- **Musical Projects:** Philadelphia Slick, Beats & Watson, Noesis (Solo), Red Martina (with Stoupe the Enemy of Mankind, Ish Quintero, and Hayley Cass).
