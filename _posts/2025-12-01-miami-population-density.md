Analyze housing occupancy and population in Miami, Florida and analyze data accuracy and differences when viewed at different scales or manipulated in different ways. This problem, that of varying statistical results based on the level of data aggregation, is known as the Modifiable Areal Unit Problem (MAUP).

ArcGIS Pro was used to create various maps visualizing population and housing occupancy data at different geographic levels in Miami, Florida, including census tracts and block groups. Though a census tract may seem relatively vacant, changing the scale to analyze census blocks may demonstrate the area in question has smaller concentrated areas of high occupancy.
