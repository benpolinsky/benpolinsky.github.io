The goal here was to assess possible locations for Philadelphia's newest healthy food store
based on a few requirements: proximity to rail transit, competition with similar businesses,
and location within a Philadelphia Empowerment Zones. The last factor was the most
limiting, reducing choicess to four sections in North Philadelphia and one in West
Philadelphia. As a contrast, public transit runs through much of the city, raising questions
about the need for the new store to be located within an empowerment zone.

To choose between the five possible locations, I kept it simple: which has the largest
area, providing us with more customers and potentially more sites on which to build. The
most favorable location is a roughly 10 million sq ft area located on North Broad St.

This exercise was completed using geoprocessing tools in ArcGIS Pro, including
spatial joins, buffers, intersection, union, erase, polygon clip, point in
polygon, dissolve, and multipart to singlepart.
