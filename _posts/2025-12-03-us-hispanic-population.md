How can we understand the number and distribution of Hispanic populations across the
Contiguous United States? Which types of maps can best represent different types of
data?

Using basic symbology and classification techniques in ArcGIS Pro, I created
various maps to visualize the total Hispanic population and the percentage of
Hispanic residents in each state across the country.

However, upon further inspection, I think it's clear my data is flawed. The numbers
don't pass the smell test - they should be much larger. Looking back, I see I used
incorrect fields from the census data table. This is a good reminder to always
double-check your data sources and ensure you're using the right variables for your
analysis.
